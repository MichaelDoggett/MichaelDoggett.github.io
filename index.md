My research interests center around image synthesis using both custom and programmable hardware.

From 2018 to 2020 I was a Visiting Professor at <a class="external-link-new-window" href="https://youtu.be/RueT9FhiCtg" title="Opens internal link in current window">Facebook Reality Labs</a> in Redmond, Washington, U.S.A working on Low-Power Ray Tracing Hardware.

From 2001 to 2009 I was a Graphics Hardware Architect at ATI in Marlborough, Massachusetts, U.S.A. ATI was purchased by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amd.com/">AMD</a>&nbsp;in 2006. While there I worked on the XBox360, Radeon 2900, 4800, 5800 and 6800.

From 1998 to 2001 I was a researcher at the WSI/GRIS computer graphics lab at the <a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/">University of Tübingen</a>, Germany. While there I worked on the VIZARDII project for hardware accelerated Volume Rendering, and displacement map rendering using custom hardware and commodity graphics hardware and subdivision surface rendering.

From 1996 to 1998, I worked as Chief Engineer at Conja, a Special Effects, Animation and Design company in Sydney, Australia.

I completed my Bachelor of Computer Science in 1990, my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering in 1992, and my Doctor of Philosopy in 1997 all at the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">The University of New South Wales</a>, Sydney, Australia.
